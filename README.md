### *WINNERS (1st RANK)* AT MANTHAN 2021 Organised BY: The Bureau of Police Research and Development, Ministry of Education's Innovation Cell (MIC) & AICTE (India)

### Novel Approach
The solution creates a c2 server that can be integrated with N number of websites, this allows the authority to track any visitor irrespective of whether they use a vpn or not. 

It is a complete solution that has been deployed and tested live, other than just this it also boasts additional integration of tracking pixels as well as an attack module that allows the authority to serve a unique javascript/response to a targeted visitor in real time irrespective of whether they use a vpn or not. All of which integrates with the main view.

It also provides a map like approach which gives a pictorial representation of how the connection was tunneled across web with source and destination arrows.

- country wise black listing (as well as grey lists)
- Internal network scan

Vpn Detection using:
- ASN lists
- blacklist ip
- realtime detection if ip offers vpn protocols
